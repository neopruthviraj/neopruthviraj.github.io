    Hello, my name is Chauhan Pruthviraj, and I am from Mahuva, a small town in Bhavnagar district situated on the northern coast of the Arabian Sea. Here, I am cherishing some of the fascinating moments of my life by pursuing my hobbies and striving to understand life in depth.

    I have created this website as a passion project where I will share my thoughts, experiences, and content. The content might not always be professional, but it will definitely be engaging.

    Since childhood, I have had a dream of becoming a game developer. However, due to the lack of a computer and the unavailability of proper documentation or manuals related to game development during my time, I could not fulfill this dream. 
    Yet, I am determined to learn C++ programming and work towards becoming a game developer.
